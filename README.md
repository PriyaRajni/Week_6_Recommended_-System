A recommender system (RecSys), or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing system with terms such as platform, engine, or algorithm) and sometimes only called "the algorithm" or "algorithm" 
is a subclass of information filtering system that provides suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user.
Recommender systems are particularly useful when an individual needs to choose an item from a potentially overwhelming number of items that a service may offer.
